House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This is a beginner-level project that demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict house prices based on various features. The model utilizes the Linear Regression (or Decision Tree Regressor) algorithm to predict the price of a house based on input features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and other factors.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the House Price Dataset (Kaggle or any other open source dataset repository). It contains information about house features and their corresponding prices.

Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas (for data manipulation)

NumPy (for numerical calculations)

Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)

Scikit-Learn (for implementing the machine learning model)

Steps Involved
Data Collection: The dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](insert link here) and preprocessed.

Data Cleaning: Missing values were handled, and features were appropriately processed.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Basic visualizations were created to understand the relationship between features and target values.

Model Training: A machine learning model was trained using Linear Regression or Decision Tree Regressor.

Model Evaluation: The model was evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² Score to measure its performance.

Results
The model achieved a R² Score of X%, indicating how well it fits the data. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was calculated as Y, which gives us an idea of how far off the model’s predictions are from the actual prices.
